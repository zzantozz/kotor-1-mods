# Knights of the Old Republic

This is the home of kotor 1 mods. I'm following this guide, which seems to be the gold standard for modding:
https://kotor.neocities.org/modding/mod_builds/k1/spoiler-free

There are a ton of mods to install, and the guide claims you can't use a mod manager. You have to install
everything manually. That makes it really complicated to mod this game because of the number of mods and
possible interactions between them. Therefore, I'm trying to keep track of everything needed to mod it in
the simplest way possible. I'm following the "spoiler free mod builds" part of the guide.

Phase 1: Download all the mods. I'm not being terribly picky. For each mod mentioned in the guide, I've
downloaded the necessary file(s). When there are multiple choices, I've almost always (or always?) followed
the guide's advice. I'm going to store all the downloaded archives here for posterity. On my first attempt
on 14 Sep 2025, there was no problem downloading everything listed in the guide. Who knows if that will
continue in the future? Storing everything here makes it future-proof.

Phase 2: Across the downloaded mods, some of them have very specific installation instructions. Since we
can't use a mod manager, it means we have to extract things into the overrides dir and manage the state
manually. My goal is to end up with a complete and correct overrides dir stored here. To that end, I've
prepped it all by following all of the extraction instructions to the letter. Ideally, if I ever want to
play this in the future, my goal is that all I have to do is copy this repo's overrids dir into a fresh
installation of the game's overrides dir, and everything will work. (Why hasn't someone done this already????)

I expect this takes up quite a bit of space, but storage is cheap, right?? Plus, I can archive this in a
public GH project and save local space!
